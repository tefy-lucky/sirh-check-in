# sirh-check-in
this code automates the boring and repetitive task of checking in SIRH and checking out.<br>what is SIRH? it's a quality of life tool created in our workplace. one of the many things we can do with it: employee can (and needs) to check-in when it's 9 am when working from home and check-out when it's 6 pm.<br> I won't give details on the "why" we are forced to use it. the most important thing is: I'm a **lazy developer** and I really hate boring and repetitive tasks... and because I'm in love with automation and artificial intelligence, I decided to create a very simple script to automate the checking in SIRH. so here it is! don't forget to download  [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), I used Google Chrome, don't forget to check your version before downloading. update your **"path"** environment variable to where the **".exe"** is.add **SIRH_LOGIN** and **SIRH_PASSWORD** with the corresponding values in your environment variables.
